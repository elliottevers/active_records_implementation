This is a minimal implementation of ActiveRecords.  It interacts with the
database a lot like the aforementioned ORM - read the specs to see the
operations it supports.  It was rendered mostly trivial once I learned the sqlite3
and active_support/inflector APIs, but it was still a great introduction to
object-oriented design and metaprogramming.  To see it in action, you can try it
yourself or check out my implementation of Rails where I make use of it.  The
database schema used in this example is similar to the one I used in my app,
Tenniscuous. If you want to experiment with it, you'll have to install SQLite
first.
